            "content": "It has been tricky to contribute code or documentation to the RDKit if you’re a Python programmer who doesn’t want to deal with the complexities of getting an RDKit build working. We want to make it straightforward for people to contribute, so I’m working on some recipes to make thigs easier. This is the first pass at that. . In order to fix bugs or add features in Python you need to be able to clone a local fork of the RDKit from github, modify the code in that local clone, and then run the local code in order to test it. The problem is that most RDKit functionality requires some binary components that need to be built from C++ and installed in the appropriate places. We’re going to work around that problem here by copying the binary components from a recent binary distribution of the RDKit into a local clone of the RDKit repo. . I’m going to explain each of the required steps, but the complete set of steps required is at the bottom of this post. Assuming that you have the prerequisites (explained directly below), I hope that these will “just work” for you, but one never knows… I’d like to be able to include this in the RDKit documentation, so please me know how it goes if you try the recipe out. Please do not add a comment to this blog post, I’ve created a github issue so that we have the comments in one place. If you don’t have a github account, please email me your comments and I’ll add them to the issue. . The steps explained . At the moment this recipe only works on linux and the mac. I will put together a similar recipe for windows and either do a separate post or update this one. . Prerequisites: . you need to have either anaconda python or miniconda installed and in your path | you need to have git installed and in your path | . You should start by changing into the directory where you want to clone the RDKit source repository and then running: . git clone https://github.com/rdkit/rdkit.git . That will clone the repo from github into a local directory called rdkit. We now change into that directory and use it to set our RDBASE environment variable: . cd rdkit export RDBASE=`pwd` . The next step is to create the conda environment that we’re going to use to hold the RDKit binary components and install a recent beta version of the RDKit into that environment: . conda create -y -n py37_rdkit_beta python=3.7 conda activate py37_rdkit_beta conda install -y -c rdkit/label/beta rdkit . If you have other Python packages that you’d like to work with, go ahead and install them into the environment now. . Next we copy the RDKit binary components from that environment into our local clone of the RDKit repo: . cd $CONDA_PREFIX/lib/python3.7/site-packages/rdkit rsync -a -m --include &#39;*/&#39; --include=&#39;*.so&#39; --include=&#39;inchi.py&#39; --exclude=&#39;*&#39; . $RDBASE/rdkit . NOTE: that rsync command should be one long line. . Finally we set our PYTHONPATH and then test that everything is working by importing the RDKit’s Chem module: . export PYTHONPATH=&quot;$RDBASE&quot; cd $RDBASE/rdkit python -c &#39;from rdkit import Chem;print(Chem.__file__)&#39; . That last command should not generate errors and should show you a filename that is in your local github clone. As an example, I started the first step of this process in my /scratch/rdkit_devel directory, so I see: . /scratch/rdkit_devel/rdkit/rdkit/Chem/__init__.py . Running the tests . If you’re planning on making an RDKit contribution, it’s important to know how to run the Python tests to make sure that your changes work and don’t break anything else. For historic reasons the RDKit uses a self-written framework for running tests, but it’s easy enough to use. You need to run the script $RDBASE/rdkit/TestRunner.py and point it to the test_list.py file containing the tests to be run. For example, if you want to run all the tests in the directory $RDBASE/rdkit/Chem (this corresponds to the python module rdkit.Chem), you would do: . cd $RDBASE/rdkit/Chem python $RDBASE/rdkit/TestRunner.py test_list.py . That will take a while and generate a lot of output, including things that look like exceptions and errors, but should finish with something like: . Script: test_list.py. Passed 40 tests in 69.70 seconds . Finishing up . You’re set. The one thing to remember is that whenever you want to use this environment in a new terminal window or shell, you need to activate the py37_rdkit_beta conda environment (don’t delete it!), set RDBASE, and set your PYTHONPATH: . conda activate py37_rdkit_beta cd your_local_rdkit_clone # &lt;- replace this with the real name of the directory export RDBASE=`pwd` export PYTHONPATH=&quot;$RDBASE&quot; . The recipe . Here’s the complete recipe: . git clone https://github.com/rdkit/rdkit.git cd rdkit export RDBASE=`pwd` conda create -y -n py37_rdkit_beta python=3.7 conda activate py37_rdkit_beta conda install -y -c rdkit/label/beta rdkit cd $CONDA_PREFIX/lib/python3.7/site-packages/rdkit rsync -a -m --include &#39;*/&#39; --include=&#39;*.so&#39; --include=&#39;inchi.py&#39; --exclude=&#39;*&#39; . $RDBASE/rdkit export PYTHONPATH=&quot;$RDBASE&quot; cd $RDBASE/rdkit python -c &#39;from rdkit import Chem;print(Chem.__file__)&#39; .",

            "content": "This is one that came up recently on the mailing list that I thought made for a good example to demonstrate how to write Python to do some more advanced structural searches with the RDKit. . from rdkit import Chem from rdkit.Chem import Draw from rdkit.Chem.Draw import IPythonConsole import rdkit print(rdkit.__version__) . 2019.09.3 . RDKit WARNING: [05:43:19] Enabling RDKit 2019.09.3 jupyter extensions . My paraphrasing of the problem: Alexis wanted to be able to do the equivalent of a substructure search that finds all aromatic rings that have both Cl and Br substituents. So he wanted to be able to match the first two of these, but not the second: . ms = [Chem.MolFromSmiles(x) for x in &#39;Clc1c(Br)cccc1 Clc1cc(Br)ccc1 Clc1cccc2c1c(Br)ccc2&#39;.split()] Draw.MolsToGridImage(ms,legends=&#39;match match no-match&#39;.split()) . It&#39;s really non-trivial to do this with SMARTS since it has no way to express that two atoms should be in the same ring without making the ring explicit in the SMARTS. I was able to come up with this SMARTS, which works, but is unwieldy (at best): . p = Chem.MolFromSmarts(&#39;Cl[c;$(c1(Cl)c(Br)cccc1),$(c1(Cl)cc(Br)ccc1),$(c1(Cl)ccc(Br)cc1)]&#39;) print([m.HasSubstructMatch(p) for m in ms]) . [True, True, False] . So that does what we want, but it only handles six rings where every atom is a C. That second part is easy enough to change in the SMARTS, but handling other ring sizes starts to make the SMARTS really long. . A more difficult problem is that, because we use recursive SMARTS, we can&#39;t get the atoms matching the query. The pattern I used above would only return the Cl atom and the C atom it&#39;s connected to. I&#39;m not sure Alexis even wanted to do that, but by this point I was interested in the problem and decided to write some Python to solve the problem flexibly. . Here we go. . Before introducing the code and showing what it can do, a quick intro on the two pieces of functionality I&#39;m going to be using from Python&#39;s itertools module. These are really useful. . Let&#39;s start with using itertools to flatten a sequence of sequences: . import itertools seqs = [[1,2,3],[&#39;a&#39;,&#39;b&#39;],[10,20]] list(itertools.chain.from_iterable(seqs)) . [1, 2, 3, &#39;a&#39;, &#39;b&#39;, 10, 20] . And to generate all the permutations of combinations of those sequences: . list(itertools.product(*seqs)) . [(1, &#39;a&#39;, 10), (1, &#39;a&#39;, 20), (1, &#39;b&#39;, 10), (1, &#39;b&#39;, 20), (2, &#39;a&#39;, 10), (2, &#39;a&#39;, 20), (2, &#39;b&#39;, 10), (2, &#39;b&#39;, 20), (3, &#39;a&#39;, 10), (3, &#39;a&#39;, 20), (3, &#39;b&#39;, 10), (3, &#39;b&#39;, 20)] . Ok, that&#39;s the background, let&#39;s define the functions we&#39;ll use: . import itertools def getAromaticRings(mol): &quot;&quot;&quot; generator returning all aromatic rings (=only aromatic bonds) in a molecule Parameters - mol : Mol Yields set IDs of the atoms in an aromatic ring &quot;&quot;&quot; ri = mol.GetRingInfo() for ring in ri.BondRings(): ats = set() isArom = True for bi in ring: bnd = mol.GetBondWithIdx(bi) if not bnd.GetIsAromatic(): isArom = False break ats.add(bnd.GetBeginAtomIdx()) ats.add(bnd.GetEndAtomIdx()) if isArom: yield ats def getSharedRings(mol,queries,rings=None,excludeQueries=None): &quot;&quot;&quot; generator returning all rings that contain all the atoms defined in queries the first atom matching each query should be in the ring Parameters - mol : Mol queries : sequence of Mols rings : list/tuple/set of list/tuple/sets, optional sequence of rings defined by sequences of atom ids If this isn&#39;t provided, all of the molecule&#39;s rings will be used excludeQueries : sequence of Mols, optional any ring containing an atom matching the first atom in any of these queries will be excluded Yields - set containing atom IDs for a matching ring &quot;&quot;&quot; if rings is None: rings = mol.GetRingInfo().AtomRings() alreadySeen = [] rings = [set(x) for x in rings] matchSets = [[x[0] for x in mol.GetSubstructMatches(q)] for q in queries] if excludeQueries is not None: exclude = [[x[0] for x in mol.GetSubstructMatches(q)] for q in excludeQueries] # flatten the lists of matches into a set: exclude = set(itertools.chain.from_iterable(exclude)) else: exclude = set() for combo in itertools.product(*matchSets): scombo = set(combo) if len(scombo) &lt; len(combo): # degenerate: continue for ring in rings: if ring in alreadySeen: continue if scombo.issubset(ring) and exclude.isdisjoint(ring): alreadySeen.append(ring) yield ring def drawMolWithRings(mol,rings): &quot;&quot;&quot; draws a molecule with a set of rings highlighted Parameters - mol : Mol rings : list/tuple/set of list/tuple/sets sequence of rings defined by sequences of atom IDs Returns - Image &quot;&quot;&quot; bondsToHighlight=[] for bnd in mol.GetBonds(): keep = False ats = set([bnd.GetBeginAtomIdx(),bnd.GetEndAtomIdx()]) for ring in rings: if ats.issubset(ring): keep = True break if keep: bondsToHighlight.append(bnd.GetIdx()) highlightAtoms = list(itertools.chain.from_iterable(rings)) tmol = Draw.PrepareMolForDrawing(mol) d2d = Draw.MolDraw2DCairo(300, 250) d2d.DrawMolecule(tmol, highlightAtoms=highlightAtoms, highlightBonds = bondsToHighlight) d2d.FinishDrawing() return Draw._drawerToImage(d2d) . This is the molecule we&#39;ll work with: . mol = Chem.MolFromSmiles(&#39;c1c(Cl)cc(Br)c2c1CCc3c2cc(Cl)c4c3CCC(Cl)C4Br&#39;) mol . Show what the getAromaticRings() function returns here: . rings = list(getAromaticRings(mol)) rings . [{0, 1, 3, 4, 6, 7}, {10, 11, 12, 13, 15, 16}] . We can use drawMolWithRings() to highlight those atoms: . drawMolWithRings(mol,rings) . Now let&#39;s look at Alexis&#39; question: find all the aromatic rings that have a Cl and a Br attached: . matches = list(getSharedRings(mol,[Chem.MolFromSmarts(sma) for sma in (&#39;[a]-Cl&#39;,&#39;[a]-Br&#39;)], rings=getAromaticRings(mol))) print(matches) drawMolWithRings(mol,matches) . [{0, 1, 3, 4, 6, 7}] . What about aromatic rings that have both a Cl and an aliphatic C attached? . matches = list(getSharedRings(mol,[Chem.MolFromSmarts(sma) for sma in (&#39;[a]-Cl&#39;,&#39;[a]-C&#39;)], rings=getAromaticRings(mol))) print(matches) drawMolWithRings(mol,matches) . [{0, 1, 3, 4, 6, 7}, {16, 10, 11, 12, 13, 15}] . What about just finding any rings (not just aromatic) that have both Cl and Br connected? . Here we just drop the rings argument to getSharedRings(), it will use all of the molecule&#39;s rings: . matches = list(getSharedRings(mol,[Chem.MolFromSmarts(sma) for sma in (&#39;[*]-Cl&#39;,&#39;[*]-Br&#39;)])) print(matches) drawMolWithRings(mol,matches) . [{0, 1, 3, 4, 6, 7}, {15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 21}] . We can also find any rings that have a Cl, but not a Br: . matches = list(getSharedRings(mol,[Chem.MolFromSmarts(sma) for sma in (&#39;[*]-Cl&#39;,)], excludeQueries=[Chem.MolFromSmarts(sma) for sma in (&#39;[*]-Br&#39;,)])) print(matches) drawMolWithRings(mol,matches) . [{10, 11, 12, 13, 15, 16}] . We aren&#39;t limited to just six membered rings, of course. Go back to the original query for aromatic rings with both Cl and Br attached: . mol = Chem.MolFromSmiles(&#39;Clc1[nH]c(Br)c(c2ccc(Cl)c(Br)c2)c1&#39;) matches = list(getSharedRings(mol,[Chem.MolFromSmarts(sma) for sma in (&#39;[*]-Cl&#39;,&#39;[*]-Br&#39;)], rings=getAromaticRings(mol))) print(matches) drawMolWithRings(mol,matches) . [{1, 2, 3, 5, 14}, {6, 7, 8, 9, 11, 13}] . What about aromatic rings that have both Cl and Br attached, but that don&#39;t contain a heteroatom? . mol = Chem.MolFromSmiles(&#39;Clc1[nH]c(Br)c(c2ccc(Cl)c(Br)c2)c1&#39;) matches = list(getSharedRings(mol,[Chem.MolFromSmarts(sma) for sma in (&#39;[*]-Cl&#39;,&#39;[*]-Br&#39;)], rings=getAromaticRings(mol), excludeQueries=[Chem.MolFromSmarts(sma) for sma in (&#39;[a;!#6]&#39;,)])) print(matches) drawMolWithRings(mol,matches) . [{6, 7, 8, 9, 11, 13}] . Hopefully there&#39;s some useful stuff in here for you! .",

            "title": "Trying out the new tautomer canonicalization code",
            "content": "During the 2018 RDKit Google Summer of Code (GSoC) project to port MolVS to C++, doing the tautomer enumeration and canonicalization were stretch goals. Susan actually managed to complete the tautomer enumeration, but since canonicalization wasn&#39;t complete, we didn&#39;t publicize this particularly widely. As part of the work for the 2020.03 release, I implemented Matt&#39;s canonicalization scheme and we recently merged that into the RDKit core. Since this is a topic that may be contentious, and since making changes to the canonicalization algorithm post-release will have be done very deliberately, I&#39;d like to collect some feedback before we do the release in a couple of months. . The implementation attempts to exactly duplicate what is currently being done in MolVS. Here&#39;s how Matt describes the process in the MolVS documentation: . Enumerate all possible tautomers using transform rules. | Use scoring system to determine canonical tautomer. | Canonical tautomer should be “reasonable” from a chemist’s point of view, but isn’t guaranteed to be the most energetically favourable. | The scoring scheme: . aromatic ring (defined by all bonds being aromatic) consisting entirely of carbons: 250 points | other aromatic rings : 100 points | a set of substructures are scored (if present). Here&#39;s the current (as of this writing) set of substructures and their associated scores (these are defined here): . {&quot;benzoquinone&quot;, &quot;[#6]1([#6]=[#6][#6]([#6]=[#6]1)=,:[N,S,O])=,:[N,S,O]&quot;, 25}, {&quot;oxim&quot;, &quot;[#6]=[N][OH]&quot;, 4}, {&quot;C=O&quot;, &quot;[#6]=,:[#8]&quot;, 2}, {&quot;N=O&quot;, &quot;[#7]=,:[#8]&quot;, 2}, {&quot;P=O&quot;, &quot;[#15]=,:[#8]&quot;, 2}, {&quot;C=hetero&quot;, &quot;[#6]=[!#1;!#6]&quot;, 1}, {&quot;methyl&quot;, &quot;[CX4H3]&quot;, 1}, {&quot;guanidine terminal=N&quot;, &quot;[#7][#6](=[NR0])[#7H0]&quot;, 1}, {&quot;guanidine endocyclic=N&quot;, &quot;[#7;R][#6;R]([N])=[#7;R]&quot;, 2}, {&quot;aci-nitro&quot;, &quot;[#6]=[N+]([O-])[OH]&quot;, -4}}; . | one point is subtracted for each H attached to P, S, Se, or Te . | . The highest scoring tautomer is selected. In the event of ties, the tautomer with the lexicographically smaller canonical SMILES is picked. . If this is something you feel strongly about, please try the code out and see what you think. If you see behavior you really don&#39;t like, or that you think is a bug, please add a comment to the associated issue in github: https://github.com/rdkit/rdkit/issues/2908 (preferred) or reply to the thread that I will create on the rdkit-discuss mailing list. . Remember that the goal of the exercise here is not to produce the &quot;best&quot; tautomer, but to produce a canonical one (always the same result for molecules which are tautomerically equivalent). We hope that this is also reasonable - in that it doesn&#39;t make a chemist&#39;s eyes burn - but that&#39;s not the primary goal. . So how can you try it out? . This is C++ code, so you need an RDKit build done from the github master. I&#39;ve done conda builds and made them available for people to try. . At the moment I&#39;ve only built the beta version for python 3.7 on linux and windows. If you would like to do some testing on the Mac, let me know and I can do a build there too. . Here&#39;s how to setup a conda environment to use the beta: . % conda create -n py37_tautomer_beta python=3.7 jupyter % conda activate py37_tautomer_beta % conda install -c rdkit/label/beta rdkit . Ok, let&#39;s look at some examples: . from rdkit import Chem from rdkit.Chem.Draw import IPythonConsole from rdkit.Chem import Draw import rdkit print(rdkit.__version__) . 2020.03.1dev1 . RDKit WARNING: [11:00:33] Enabling RDKit 2020.03.1dev1 jupyter extensions . from rdkit.Chem.MolStandardize import rdMolStandardize . enumerator = rdMolStandardize.TautomerEnumerator() . m = Chem.MolFromSmiles(&#39;Oc1c(cccc3)c3nc2ccncc12&#39;) m . Get the canonical tautomer: . enumerator.Canonicalize(m) . The canonicalizer starts by enumerating a molecule&#39;s tautomers. If you want to see those, you can use the Enumerate() method: . tauts = enumerator.Enumerate(m) Draw.MolsToGridImage(tauts) . I find this function, which reorders the list of tautomers so that the canonical one is in the first position, really useful: . def reorderTautomers(m): enumerator = rdMolStandardize.TautomerEnumerator() canon = enumerator.Canonicalize(m) csmi = Chem.MolToSmiles(canon) res = [canon] tauts = enumerator.Enumerate(m) smis = [Chem.MolToSmiles(x) for x in tauts] stpl = sorted((x,y) for x,y in zip(smis,tauts) if x!=csmi) res += [y for x,y in stpl] return res . So now we can display all the tautomers found for a molecule. The first one drawn is the canonical one: . Draw.MolsToGridImage(reorderTautomers(m)) . Draw.MolsToGridImage(reorderTautomers(Chem.MolFromSmiles(&#39;CN=c1nc[nH]cc1&#39;))) . Draw.MolsToGridImage(reorderTautomers(Chem.MolFromSmiles(&#39;CC=CO&#39;))) . As an aside, it&#39;s worth noticing that double bond stereochemistry is removed in all tautomers if the double bond is involved in the tautomerization: . m = Chem.MolFromSmiles(&#39;C/C=C(/O)F&#39;) tauts = reorderTautomers(m) print(&#39;Original SMILES:&#39;,Chem.MolToSmiles(m)) print(&#39;Tautomers (canonical first):&#39;,[Chem.MolToSmiles(x) for x in tauts]) . Original SMILES: C/C=C(/O)F Tautomers (canonical first): [&#39;CCC(=O)F&#39;, &#39;CC=C(O)F&#39;] .",

            "title": "Some thoughts on the performance of the RDKit cartridge",
            "content": "EDITED on 23.01.2020 John Mayfield pointed out that the way I had constructed the set of 10 million molecules wasn’t reproducible. This update fixes that, but it also changes the results. . It’s been a while since I did a post about the cartridge! This one is a little bit ranty, but hopefully it’s still useful. . Some background and disclaimers . I normally do performance testing on the cartridge using ChEMBL, but since that’s “only” around 1.7 million compounds I wanted to try something a bit bigger. But how big? I don’t see the point in shoving 100 million compounds (or a billion) into PostgreSQL (there’s a mini-rant explaining this at the bottom of the post), so I went with 10 million. That’s more than five times bigger than ChEMBL, but it’s still not unimaginable that you’d actually have a relational schema with a molecule table this size that has data about most of those molecules in separate tables (again, see the mini-rant). . My goal here is to get a sense for what kind of performance you can expect for doing “normal” chemical queries using a local PostgreSQL instance without having to spend time optimizing the database or hardware configuration. I generated all the numbers below on my Linux desktop - which is 4-5 years old at this point - using an out-of-the-box install of PostgreSQL 12 (the only configuration tuning was to increase the size of shared_buffers to 4096M and work_mem as described in the RDKit docs). I was also using the machine for other things (like reading email or writing this post in Chrome) while these queries ran, so the numbers are really just ballpark estimates. . So which molecules to use? Rather than agonizing overly much about this, I just grabbed a PubChem Compound SMILES dump and took the first 10 million molecules from that. . I hedged above by saying “normal” chemical queries. I have a longer rant about that topic that I will spare you the details of, but I generally think that including worst-case queries (i.e. things that return tens or hundreds of thousands of rows) in real-world benchmarking examples is pointless. It’s definitely useful to understand the worst-case performance of a system, but that’s not what I’m doing here. So my queries will often limit the number of rows returned to what I think is a “reasonable” number for interactive usage. . Creating the database . This tends to be time consuming, particularly creating the molecule index. Start by creating the database from the command line and loading all of the raw data: . glandrum@otter:/tmp/pubchem_load$ createdb pubchem_compound glandrum@otter:/tmp/pubchem_load$ psql -c &#39;create extension rdkit&#39; pubchem_compound CREATE EXTENSION glandrum@otter:/tmp/pubchem_load$ psql -c &#39;create table raw_data (id SERIAL,cid integer, smiles text)&#39; pubchem_compound CREATE TABLE glandrum@otter:/tmp/pubchem_load$ zcat CID-SMILES.gz | sed &#39;s/ / /g&#39; | psql -c &quot;copy raw_data (cid,smiles) from stdin with delimiter E&#39; t&#39;&quot; pubchem_compound COPY 102397130 . Now create the molecule table and build the index: . pubchem_compound=# alter table raw_data add primary key (cid); ALTER TABLE pubchem_compound=# timing Timing is on. pubchem_compound=# select * into mols from (select cid,mol_from_smiles(smiles::cstring) m from raw_data order by cid limit 10000000) tmp where m is not null; ... lots of info about failing molecules deleted here WARNING: could not create molecule from SMILES &#39;[B+]12(CC3CC(C1)CC(C2)C3)NCC[O-]&#39; WARNING: could not create molecule from SMILES &#39;[B+]12(CC3CC(C1)CC(C2)C3)NCCO&#39; SELECT 9999165 Time: 1722464.775 ms (28:42.465) pubchem_compound=# create index molidx on mols using gist(m); CREATE INDEX Time: 3735718.147 ms (01:02:15.718) . Add fingerprints and their index along with the primary keys we’ll use to link things: . pubchem_compound=# create index fps_mfp2_idx on fps using gist(mfp2); CREATE INDEX Time: 155112.279 ms (02:35.112) pubchem_compound=# alter table mols add primary key (cid); ALTER TABLE Time: 44271.680 ms (00:44.272) pubchem_compound=# alter table fps add primary key (cid); ALTER TABLE Time: 27675.441 ms (00:27.675) . Now let’s do some queries. . Substructure queries . Note that all of the results below are done with a “warm” disk cache: I ran a substructure search and similarity search to try and ensure that at least parts of the indices are being cached by the operating system. . Picking the queries for a demo is always tricky, and can obviously completely slant the results one way or another, so I went to the ASAP page for J Med Chem and pulled stuff from there. . Let’s start with a query for parts of the “head” and “gate” from this paper: https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.jmedchem.9b01912 . pubchem_compound=# select * from mols where m@&gt;&#39;CC1=C(C=C(C=C1)C(N)=O)C#CC1=CN=CC=C1&#39; limit 10; cid | m -+- 11526637 | Cc1ccc(C(=O)Nc2cc(OC[C@@H]3CCCN3C)cc(C(F)(F)F)c2)cc1C#Cc1cnc2nc[nH]c2c1 (1 row) Time: 5359.046 ms (00:05.359) . Here’s the one hit: . . Now the core from: https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.jmedchem.9b01427 . pubchem_compound=# select * from mols where m@&gt;&#39;CC1=CC2=C(S1)C(=O)NC(C)=N2&#39; limit 10; cid | m -+ 3758971 | CCOC(=O)C1CCCn2c1nc1cc(-c3ccccc3)sc1c2=O 10622152 | COc1ccc(NC(=S)Nn2c(C)nc3cc(-c4ccccc4)sc3c2=O)cc1 1040399 | COC(=O)[C@@H]1CCc2nc3cc(-c4ccc(OC)cc4)sc3c(=O)n21 1040400 | COC(=O)[C@H]1CCc2nc3cc(-c4ccc(OC)cc4)sc3c(=O)n21 3310123 | O=c1c2sc(-c3ccccc3)cc2nc2n1CCCCC2 4376566 | CCOC(=O)C1CCCn2c1nc1cc(-c3ccc(OC)cc3)sc1c2=O 10574247 | COc1ccccc1NC(=S)Nn1c(C)nc2cc(-c3ccccc3)sc2c1=O 11404362 | Cc1cc2nc(-c3ccccc3)n(-c3ccccc3)c(=O)c2s1 10716322 | Cc1cccc(NC(=S)Nn2c(C)nc3cc(-c4ccccc4)sc3c2=O)c1 661611 | COc1ccc(-c2cc3nc4n(c(=O)c3s2)CCOC4)cc1 (10 rows) Time: 6.532 ms . And the results: . . And, finally, the core from: https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.jmedchem.9b01684 . pubchem_compound=# select * from mols where m@&gt;&#39;CN1C(=O)N(C)C2=C1C=NC(N)=N2&#39; limit 10; cid | m -+ 10359733 | C=CCn1c(=O)n(CCCCCCCC)c2nc(N)nc(Cl)c21 10452174 | Nc1nc2c(c(=O)n1N)n(CCCl)c(=O)n2[C@@H]1O[C@H](CO)[C@@H](O)[C@H]1O 10048317 | Nc1nc2c(c(=O)n1N)n(C/C=C/c1ccccc1)c(=O)n2[C@@H]1O[C@H](CO)[C@@H](O)[C@H]1O 10454396 | [N-]=[N+]=NCC(O)Cn1c(=O)n([C@@H]2O[C@H](CO)[C@@H](O)[C@H]2O)c2nc(N)n(N)c(=O)c21 10476329 | Nc1nc2c(c(=O)n1N)n(Cc1ccccc1)c(=O)n2[C@@H]1O[C@H](CO)[C@@H](O)[C@H]1O 11428584 | C=CCn1c(=O)n([C@@H]2O[C@H](CO)[C@@H](O)[C@H]2O)c2nc(N)nc(OCC)c21 11453816 | C=CCn1c(=O)n([C@@H]2O[C@H](CO)[C@@H](O)[C@H]2O)c2nc(N)nc(OCN(C)C(=O)OCC)c21 9980347 | COc1ccc(Cn2c(=O)n([C@@H]3O[C@H](CO)[C@@H](O)[C@H]3O)c3nc(N)n(N)c(=O)c32)cc1 10085856 | Cn1c(=O)n2c3c1c(=O)nc(N)n3C[C@H]1O[C@@H]2[C@H](O)[C@@H]1O 9994808 | C=CCn1c(=O)n(CCCCO)c2nc(N)nc(Cl)c21 (10 rows) Time: 107.934 ms . And the first results: . . These queries are, in general, pretty quick. I’m certainly likely to spend more time looking at the results than I am waiting for them to come back. . One point it’s worth making is that queries that don’t return any results tend to be pretty fast. Here’s an example of that: . pubchem_compound=# select * from mols where m@&gt;&#39;O1C=NC2=C1N=C1N=CN=CC1=N2&#39; limit 5; cid | m --+ (0 rows) Time: 9.778 ms . Note that this is definitely not always true… the index does not work particularly well for queries that have massively repeating common substructures: . pubchem_compound=# select * from mols where m@&gt;&#39;COCOCOCOCOCOCOCOCOCOCOCOCOCOCOCOCOCOCCOCOCOCOCOCCO&#39; limit 5; cid | m --+ (0 rows) Time: 150521.647 ms (02:30.522) . Remember what I said about about worst-case performance? There ya go. . Similarity queries . Now let’s do some similarity searches using the molecule drawn in the graphical abstract as queries. For this blog post I’m going to use the cartridge’s “neighbor” operator &lt;%&gt; to order the results and allow the N closest neighbors of each query molecule to be retrieved. Here’s the simple SQL function that I use for doing that: . pubchem_compound=# pubchem_compound=# create or replace function get_mfp2_neighbors2(smiles text) returns table(cid integer, m mol, similarity double precision) as $$ select cid,m,tanimoto_sml(morganbv_fp(mol_from_smiles($1::cstring)),mfp2) as similarity from fps join mols using (cid) order by morganbv_fp(mol_from_smiles($1::cstring))&lt;%&gt;mfp2; $$ language sql stable ; . That’s adapted from the function get_mfp2_neighbors that is in the RDKit cartridge documentation. . Let’s start with a query for the five nearest neighbors of balovaptan (https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.jmedchem.9b01478): . pubchem_compound=# select * from get_mfp2_neighbors2(&#39;CN1CC2=NN=C(C3CCC(CC3)OC3=CC=CC=N3)N2C2=CC=C(Cl)C=C2C1&#39;) limit 5; cid | m | similarity -+-+-- 11237434 | CN1Cc2cc(Cl)ccc2-n2c(nnc2C2CCN(c3ccccn3)CC2)C1 | 0.7049180327868853 11237433 | CN1Cc2cc(Cl)ccc2-n2c(nnc2C2CCN(c3ccccn3)CC2)C1.Cl.Cl.Cl | 0.6935483870967742 10070061 | CN1CCc2cc(Cl)ccc2-n2c(nnc2C2CCN(c3ccccn3)CC2)C1 | 0.6212121212121212 11270862 | Cc1ccccc1CC(=O)N1CCC(c2nnc3n2-c2ccc(Cl)cc2CN(C)C3)CC1 | 0.5797101449275363 11442570 | CN1Cc2cc(Cl)ccc2-n2c(nnc2C2CCN(C(=O)c3c[nH]c4ccccc34)CC2)C1 | 0.5774647887323944 (5 rows) Time: 239.879 ms . It’s easy (and quick) to expand that to the ten nearest neighbors: . pubchem_compound=# select * from get_mfp2_neighbors2(&#39;CN1CC2=NN=C(C3CCC(CC3)OC3=CC=CC=N3)N2C2=CC=C(Cl)C=C2C1&#39;) limit 10; cid | m | similarity -+-+-- 11237434 | CN1Cc2cc(Cl)ccc2-n2c(nnc2C2CCN(c3ccccn3)CC2)C1 | 0.7049180327868853 11237433 | CN1Cc2cc(Cl)ccc2-n2c(nnc2C2CCN(c3ccccn3)CC2)C1.Cl.Cl.Cl | 0.6935483870967742 10070061 | CN1CCc2cc(Cl)ccc2-n2c(nnc2C2CCN(c3ccccn3)CC2)C1 | 0.6212121212121212 11270862 | Cc1ccccc1CC(=O)N1CCC(c2nnc3n2-c2ccc(Cl)cc2CN(C)C3)CC1 | 0.5797101449275363 11442570 | CN1Cc2cc(Cl)ccc2-n2c(nnc2C2CCN(C(=O)c3c[nH]c4ccccc34)CC2)C1 | 0.5774647887323944 11486399 | CN1Cc2cc(Cl)ccc2-n2c(nnc2C2CCN(C(=O)CC3CC3)CC2)C1 | 0.5757575757575758 11349733 | CCCC(=O)N1CCC(c2nnc3n2-c2ccc(Cl)cc2CN(C)C3)CC1 | 0.5757575757575758 11305733 | CN1Cc2cc(Cl)ccc2-n2c(nnc2C2CCN(C(=O)c3cc4ccccc4[nH]3)CC2)C1 | 0.5694444444444444 11166614 | CN1Cc2cc(Cl)ccc2-n2c(nnc2C2CCN(C(=O)C3(C)CCCCC3)CC2)C1 | 0.5671641791044776 10028677 | CN1CCOC(CN2Cc3cc(Cl)ccc3-n3c(nnc3C3CCN(c4ccccn4)CC3)C2)C1 | 0.5616438356164384 (10 rows) Time: 189.425 ms . Here are the first few of those, along with the similarity values: . . The five nearest neighbors for AZD7648 (https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.jmedchem.9b01684) aren’t particularly similar: . pubchem_compound=# select * from get_mfp2_neighbors2(&#39;CN1C(=O)N(C2CCOCC2)C2=C1C=NC(NC1=CN3N=CN=C3C=C1C)=N2&#39;) limit 5; cid | m | similarity -+--+ 11504903 | Cn1c(=O)c(=O)n(C2CCCC2)c2nc(Nc3ccc(C(=O)NC4CCC(N5CCOCC5)CC4)cc3)ncc21 | 0.4166666666666667 11406590 | Cn1c(=O)c(Oc2ccc(F)cc2F)cc2cnc(NC3CCOCC3)nc21 | 0.3924050632911392 10230233 | Cc1cc(=O)n(C2CCCC2)c2nc(Nc3ccc(N4CCC(CCCN5CCOCC5)CC4)cc3)ncc12 | 0.3595505617977528 9801449 | Cc1nc2cnc(Nc3ccc(N4CCOCC4)cc3)nc2n(C2CCCC2)c1=O | 0.35443037974683544 10224126 | Cc1cc(=O)n(C2CCCC2)c2nc(Nc3ccc(N4CCOCC4)c(F)c3)ncc12 | 0.3488372093023256 (5 rows) Time: 219.653 ms . As we can see: . . The performance of these queries isn’t quite as good as what you can do with specialized open-source tools like chemfp, gpusimilarity, or FPSim2, but I think it’s reasonable for retrieving a set of neighbors that I’m then going to do (probably more time consuming) further analysis on. . Note that the similarity queries were considerably slower in the original version of this blog post. This was likely due to me doing a bad job of warming up the disk cache. . Some technical details: .

Performance of the substructure indices . Here are results for the substructure queries executed above. For the purposes of this analysis I removed the limit on the query: . pubchem_compound=# explain analyze select * from mols where m@&gt;&#39;CC1=C(C=C(C=C1)C(N)=O)C#CC1=CN=CC=C1&#39;; QUERY PLAN Bitmap Heap Scan on mols (cost=2157.91..37897.03 rows=9999 width=398) (actual time=167.546..168.902 rows=1 loops=1) Recheck Cond: (m @&gt; &#39;Cc1ccc(C(N)=O)cc1C#Cc1cccnc1&#39;::mol) Rows Removed by Index Recheck: 328 Heap Blocks: exact=309 -&gt; Bitmap Index Scan on molidx (cost=0.00..2155.41 rows=9999 width=0) (actual time=137.703..137.703 rows=329 loops=1) Index Cond: (m @&gt; &#39;Cc1ccc(C(N)=O)cc1C#Cc1cccnc1&#39;::mol) Planning Time: 0.119 ms Execution Time: 169.178 ms (8 rows) pubchem_compound=# explain analyze select * from mols where m@&gt;&#39;CC1=CC2=C(S1)C(=O)NC(C)=N2&#39;; QUERY PLAN -- Bitmap Heap Scan on mols (cost=2157.91..37897.03 rows=9999 width=398) (actual time=436.998..510.558 rows=46 loops=1) Recheck Cond: (m @&gt; &#39;Cc1nc2cc(C)sc2c(=O)[nH]1&#39;::mol) Rows Removed by Index Recheck: 14 Heap Blocks: exact=55 -&gt; Bitmap Index Scan on molidx (cost=0.00..2155.41 rows=9999 width=0) (actual time=436.902..436.902 rows=60 loops=1) Index Cond: (m @&gt; &#39;Cc1nc2cc(C)sc2c(=O)[nH]1&#39;::mol) Planning Time: 0.113 ms Execution Time: 510.801 ms (8 rows) pubchem_compound=# explain analyze select * from mols where m@&gt;&#39;CN1C(=O)N(C)C2=C1C=NC(N)=N2&#39;; QUERY PLAN - Bitmap Heap Scan on mols (cost=2157.91..37897.03 rows=9999 width=398) (actual time=5111.590..5113.136 rows=38 loops=1) Recheck Cond: (m @&gt; &#39;Cn1c(=O)n(C)c2nc(N)ncc21&#39;::mol) Rows Removed by Index Recheck: 10 Heap Blocks: exact=48 -&gt; Bitmap Index Scan on molidx (cost=0.00..2155.41 rows=9999 width=0) (actual time=5081.767..5081.768 rows=48 loops=1) Index Cond: (m @&gt; &#39;Cn1c(=O)n(C)c2nc(N)ncc21&#39;::mol) Planning Time: 0.058 ms Execution Time: 5113.296 ms (8 rows) . All of those show that the index is doing a reasonably good job of pruning compounds - the worst case query (the first one) only ends up trying at 329 substructure queries (instead of 10 million!) to find the 1 actual match. . Warming up the disk cache . There are tons of ways to do this. Here’s the approach I used for this post: . pubchem_compound=# select cid,mol_murckoscaffold(m) scaff into temporary table scaffs from mols order by cid desc limit 10; SELECT 10 pubchem_compound=# select count(*) from mols cross join scaffs where mols.m@&gt;scaffs.scaff; count -- 178828 (1 row) pubchem_compound=# select * into blah from fps order by cid desc limit 10; SELECT 10 pubchem_compound=# select count(*) from fps cross join blah where blah.mfp2%fps.mfp2; count - 401 (1 row) . That takes ~10 minutes to run for me. . Doing the queries and making the images . Since I’m not doing this one from a jupyter notebook, here’s the code snippet I’m using in jupyter to do the substructure queries and display the results: . q=&#39;CN1C(=O)N(C)C2=C1C=NC(N)=N2&#39; t1=time.time() d = %sql postgresql://localhost/pubchem_compound select * from mols where m@&gt;:q limit 10; t2 = time.time() print(f&#39;{t2-t1:.2f} seconds&#39;) ms = [Chem.MolFromSmiles(x) for x in [q]+[x[1] for x in d]] ls = [&#39;query&#39;]+[str(x[0]) for x in d] Draw.MolsToGridImage(ms[:8],legends=ls,molsPerRow=4) . And the equivalent thing for nearest-neighbor queries: . q=&#39;CN1CC2=NN=C(C3CCC(CC3)OC3=CC=CC=N3)N2C2=CC=C(Cl)C=C2C1&#39; t1=time.time() d = %sql postgresql://localhost/pubchem_compound select * from get_mfp2_neighbors2(:q) limit 10; t2 = time.time() print(f&#39;{t2-t1:.2f} seconds&#39;) ms = [Chem.MolFromSmiles(x) for x in [q]+[x[1] for x in d]] ls = [&#39;query&#39;]+[f&#39;{x[0]} {x[2] :.2f}&#39; for x in d] Draw.MolsToGridImage(ms[:8],legends=ls,molsPerRow=4) . Both of these are using the fantastic sql-magic for jupyter from Catherine Devlin. . Mini-rant . PostgreSQL is a general purpose relational database, it lets you store collections of tables with links (relations) between them and makes it easy to do queries that combine data across tables. If you have data on a bunch of molecules that can’t be logically captured in a single table (like ChEMBL!), a relational database is a great place to put that. If you have a single table with a bunch of columns (i.e. molecules and values or fingerprints computed from them), you may want to look to another type of system. If you have a huge number of rows that you are really only interested in doing chemical queries (substructure and similarity searches) against, and you care about performance, then you almost certainly should be using a specialized system. There are plenty to choose from! .",

            "title": "Similarity maps with the new drawing code",
            "content": "As part of the 2019.09 release we added a C++ implementation of the RDKit&#39;s similarity map functionality (https://jcheminf.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1758-2946-5-43). I forgot to mention this during the &quot;What&#39;s New&quot; bit of my presentation at the UGM, but I think it&#39;s worth calling attention to. So here&#39;s a quick blog post. . from rdkit import Chem from rdkit.Chem import Draw from rdkit.Chem.Draw import SimilarityMaps from IPython.display import SVG import io from PIL import Image import numpy as np import rdkit print(rdkit.__version__) . RDKit WARNING: [11:53:45] Enabling RDKit 2019.09.2 jupyter extensions . 2019.09.2 . I start by using &quot;classic&quot; similarity map functionality to show why atorvastatin (Lipitor) and rosuvastatin (Crestor) are similar to each other when using the Morgan fingerprint. . Here are the two molecules: . atorvastatin = Chem.MolFromSmiles(&#39;O=C(O)C[C@H](O)C[C@H](O)CCn2c(c(c(c2c1ccc(F)cc1)c3ccccc3)C(=O)Nc4ccccc4)C(C)C&#39;) rosuvastatin = Chem.MolFromSmiles(&#39;OC(=O)C[C@H](O)C[C@H](O) C=C c1c(C(C)C)nc(N(C)S(=O)(=O)C)nc1c2ccc(F)cc2&#39;) Draw.MolsToGridImage((atorvastatin,rosuvastatin)) . To use the new drawing code, we create a Draw2D object and pass that to SimilarityMaps.GetSimilarityMapForFingerprint: . def show_png(data): bio = io.BytesIO(data) img = Image.open(bio) return img . d = Draw.MolDraw2DCairo(400, 400) _, maxWeight = SimilarityMaps.GetSimilarityMapForFingerprint(atorvastatin, rosuvastatin, lambda m, i: SimilarityMaps.GetMorganFingerprint(m, i, radius=2, fpType=&#39;bv&#39;), draw2d=d) d.FinishDrawing() show_png(d.GetDrawingText()) . We can do the same thing with count-based fingerprints: . d = Draw.MolDraw2DCairo(400, 400) _, maxWeight = SimilarityMaps.GetSimilarityMapForFingerprint(atorvastatin, rosuvastatin, lambda m, i: SimilarityMaps.GetMorganFingerprint(m, i, radius=2, fpType=&#39;count&#39;), draw2d=d) d.FinishDrawing() show_png(d.GetDrawingText()) . The other GetSimilarityMapFrom... functions also accept the optional draw2d argument. Here&#39;s a visualization of the contributions made by the atoms in atorvastatin to its calculatied logp value: . from rdkit.Chem import rdMolDescriptors ator_contribs = rdMolDescriptors._CalcCrippenContribs(atorvastatin) d = Draw.MolDraw2DCairo(400, 400) SimilarityMaps.GetSimilarityMapFromWeights(atorvastatin,[x[0] for x in ator_contribs],draw2d=d) d.FinishDrawing() show_png(d.GetDrawingText()) . And a couple more visualizations of various partial charge schemes. . Starting with Gasteiger-Marsilli charges: . from rdkit.Chem import rdPartialCharges rdPartialCharges.ComputeGasteigerCharges(atorvastatin) chgs = [x.GetDoubleProp(&quot;_GasteigerCharge&quot;) for x in atorvastatin.GetAtoms()] d = Draw.MolDraw2DCairo(400, 400) SimilarityMaps.GetSimilarityMapFromWeights(atorvastatin,chgs,draw2d=d) d.FinishDrawing() show_png(d.GetDrawingText()) . And also the partial charges calculated with extended Hueckel theory (eHT) using Mulliken analysis: . from rdkit.Chem import rdEHTTools from rdkit.Chem import rdDistGeom mh = Chem.AddHs(atorvastatin) rdDistGeom.EmbedMolecule(mh) _,res = rdEHTTools.RunMol(mh) static_chgs = res.GetAtomicCharges()[:atorvastatin.GetNumAtoms()] d = Draw.MolDraw2DCairo(400, 400) SimilarityMaps.GetSimilarityMapFromWeights(atorvastatin,list(static_chgs),draw2d=d) d.FinishDrawing() show_png(d.GetDrawingText()) . As one final demo, I&#39;ll use the method to visualize the variability of the eHT charges with conformation for atorvastatin. . Start by generating 10 diverse conformers, calculating the charges for each, and plotting the average: . mh = Chem.AddHs(atorvastatin) ps = rdDistGeom.ETKDGv2() ps.pruneRmsThresh = 0.5 ps.randomSeed = 0xf00d rdDistGeom.EmbedMultipleConfs(mh,10,ps) print(f&#39;Found {mh.GetNumConformers()} conformers&#39;) chgs = [] for conf in mh.GetConformers(): _,res = rdEHTTools.RunMol(mh,confId=conf.GetId()) chgs.append(res.GetAtomicCharges()[:atorvastatin.GetNumAtoms()]) chgs = np.array(chgs) mean_chgs = np.mean(chgs,axis=0) std_chgs = np.std(chgs,axis=0) d = Draw.MolDraw2DCairo(400, 400) SimilarityMaps.GetSimilarityMapFromWeights(atorvastatin,list(mean_chgs),draw2d=d) d.FinishDrawing() show_png(d.GetDrawingText()) . Found 10 conformers . That doesn&#39;t look hugely different from what we saw above. . To show the variability, plot the standard deviation of the charges across the 10 conformers: . print(std_chgs) print(max(std_chgs),min(std_chgs)) d = Draw.MolDraw2DCairo(400, 400) SimilarityMaps.GetSimilarityMapFromWeights(atorvastatin,list(std_chgs),draw2d=d) d.FinishDrawing() show_png(d.GetDrawingText()) .

The deviations aren&#39;t huge (the printed array shows that), but the largest value is clearly the amide N. . There&#39;s definitely a ToDo here to improve the way the negative contours are drawn so that the fact that they are being drawn with dashed lines is visible. .",
